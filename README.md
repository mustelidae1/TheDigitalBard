# The Digital Bard 

Web app that generates random nonsensical poetry! It's live [here](https://thedigitalbard.herokuapp.com/index.php). The current version only uses one template so the poems 
get preditable after a while, but they can be pretty entertaining nonetheless. Just enter a topic on the homepage to generate a poem. Singular nouns work best. 

You can create an account to save poems to the gallery.
